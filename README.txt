HOMEWORK 9: PERFECT HASHING


NAME:  Jacob Martin


COLLABORATORS AND OTHER RESOURCES:
List the names of everyone you talked to about this assignment
(classmates, TAs, ALAC tutors, upperclassment, students/instructor via
LMS, etc.), and all of the resources (books, online reference
material, etc.) you consulted in completing this assignment.

Remember: Your implementation for this assignment must be done on your
own, as described in "Academic Integrity for Homework" handout.



SUMMARY OF RESULTS: 
Summarize your results on the provided examples.  Were you able to
construct a perfect hash function?  If not, how close did you get (how
many collisions)?  If yes, what was the smallest perfect hash you were
able to construct for the different examples?  What was your
compression ratio?  Did you make any additional test cases?

Decrompression works fine but compression has an infinite loop.
I worked very hard on this but in the end ran into an infinite loop that I could not find in my hash data filler.
 The rest of the code should work but I spent so many hours on this one infinite loop and it in the end killed me.


OFFSET SEARCH FOR EXTRA CREDIT:
If you implemented a search strategy instead of or in addition to the
greedy method from the paper, describe it here.



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!

I would like to know how to fix the infinite loop.
